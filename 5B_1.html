    <p style = "text-align:justify;">We’ve long known that the planets of our own solar system emit powerful radio waves as their magnetic fields interact with the solar wind. This same process drives the beautiful auroras we see at the poles of Earth.Our own Earth has auroras, commonly recognized here as the northern and southern lights. These beautiful auroras also emit powerful radio waves. Astronomers first thought they’d detected a planet via its radio waves in 2020. It was thought to be orbiting a star named GJ1151. They believe that the radio signals they are detecting occur in much the same way as Earth and Jupiter emit radio waves due to the interaction of their magnetic fields with the solar wind.This is from the interaction of the planet’s magnetic field with the solar wind. But in the case of auroras from Jupiter, they’re much stronger, as its volcanic moon Io is blasting material out into space, filling Jupiter’s environment with particles that drive unusually powerful auroras. Our model for this radio light from our stars is a scaled-up version of Jupiter and Io, with an exoplanet enveloped in the magnetic field of a star, feeding material into vast currents that similarly power bright auroras on the star itself. It’s a spectacle that has attracted our attention from light-years away.

      Before the Internet, if you had a question about how to start engaging in astronomical pursuits, you had three avenues to get your answers:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Buy a book and trudge through technical jargon, spending half your time looking words up in a dictionary and re-reading previous pages, trying to wrap your head around the difference between declinations and constellations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subscribe to Sky & Telescope, or another publication, and spend half your time reading the book from issue #1, trying to get up to speed on just what they’re talking about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk to someone you knew who owned a telescope and could mentor you... OK, so you really only had two roads to take, because NO ONE you knew owned a telescope or knew how to use one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      In the infancy of the Internet, there were budding websites and chat rooms that you could visit for advice. Now, with high-speed access, websites, and apps, if you have any question, there’s already someone who has asked it, and has had it answered. And there’s probably a video about it. A quick Google search and you’re on your way, and entire communities of people are eager to help you get started.
      <br />
      <br />
      It used to be that if you were a kid and you wanted a telescope, your parents would either say that you were crazy if you thought they were going to spend a ton of money on a passing phase… or they’d get you a special from the mall. Unfortunately, either choice was horrible for you. The cheap ’scopes were more than useless and drove you away from astronomy and into the waiting arms of video games.
      day.
      <br />
      Today, a decent ’scope can be had at a price that won’t make parents break out in hives, which might even have a motorized and computer-controlled mount.
      <br />
      <br />
      This really could’ve been the #1 reason, but I wanted to end big. Back in the olden days of the 20th Century, science kids were ridiculed and derided. But that’s changing. Being smart is cool, and now we can speak in public (figuratively, if not literally) about our favorite nebula or galaxy. We can go online and find astronomy clubs, we can find like-minded people all over the Internet to talk to, ask questions, engage in debates, and just be ourselves.
